Your dad? Yeah that's why . . .  
  
**"My feeling of safety disappeared with my father"**  
  
**That's why you can't trust man, including me.**  
  
Off the medications?  
So finally you can get away from your spirit disease !  
This is the happiest thing I ever heard since we met!

Yeah because of you...  
It's okay now. It's okay now...  
Seeing you back and fine is my best cure~ ðŸ¥°  
  
Though you may hurt me thousands of times, I won't feel pain as long as it's good to you !
