## September 9th
This is the day I move into the dormitory!  
There were a lot of luggage to carry. A tired day really!  
I ought to play Mortal Kombat when everything was in order, but I took a shot.

She learned herself at home since she was 8! How amazing!  
That was mentioned yesterday, but I still feel amazed today!  
  
I said ***I wanna get into shape***, and I'm surprised I really want!  

Why? ***Did I just make a promise?***  

## September 12th
We were asked to converge in a classroom to watch a stupid online course......  
  
Luckily she chatted with me before I fell asleep, so the day didn't end that bad haha~  

## September 13th
My bicycle arrived today, but the courier couldn't drive the truck into the college. I had to carry a large heavy box with my bicycle inside......ðŸ˜«  
What's worse, it rains !!!  
All my body was wet, I can feel cold even it's nearly 30 degrees...ðŸ˜£

***I don't know if my heart was always hard before, at least this time it truly melt. ðŸ’—***  

I got cold that night, but I could feel something inside my chest, **sprouting**...
