## October 10th  
  
I finished my class.  
  
Can't wait to keep talking...only saw your ID.  
  
I'm fine.  
I feel nothing.  
  
Did that mean I grow up?  
  
## October 13rd
  
Advanced Math class......  
  
I can't breath.  
And my roomates were sitting beside me, taking photos for fun...  
  
Yeah, I wanna fuck their eyes, with my fucking pencil.  
  
***I thought I was used to it...***  
  
***Sorry I haven't make any change...haha, and I'm proud of it.***  
  
Christine. She said that you wanna know what I truly want from you.  
So I built this site, to reflect all our history, to re-feel what I felt.  
  
## October 16th 
Tomorrow, it'll be a whole week.  
  
Can't you feel any better?  
  
I don't understand what you mean innocent eyes.  
  
***Christine is in Israel...and she hasn't went online for 3 days...No one can help me figure it out. No one can teach me how to do now...***  
  
If you really study those psychological things... then why you weren't be able to see his real face?  
  
"I won't let you get depressed."  
Now I can feel it. It's already here...  
  
"There's no need for blocking."  
"I won't do that again."  
Then why...  
  
**What is lack of responsibility?**  
**I think we have got the answer. . .**  
  
Hey... Maybe it's time for you to get back...  
No matter what fact is, I will always keep my promise, and I will wait, I always wait. . . . . .  
  
***I really enjoy our time on Tandem.***   
***I really enjoy our time on WeChat.***  
***I really appriciate every second we experience together.***  
  
***In Sha Allah***
