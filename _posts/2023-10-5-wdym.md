Today, mum took me to the hospital for the blood test.  
  
Mum:"Honestly, you look wired these days. Is everything ok in the college?"  
  
-"**Hummm... Huh, I'm fine. What's wrong?**"  
  
Mum:"Anything trouble you recently?"  
  
-"**I think, no. What? Do I look like a person with some mental issues?  Lovesickness?**"  
  
Mum:"Yes, just like your brother."  
  
-"**Hummm... Yes, I just find the college isn't that challenging as I thought. A bit boring actually.**"  
  
Mum:"Ha, I thought you were in love with someone."  
  
-"**You know it's impossible. I can't share perceptions with most people."  
  
Mum:"Have you ever found someone who can share your thought with?"  
  
-"**Yes, there is one online, a foreigner.**"  
  
Mum:"Male or female?"  
  
-"**I don't know. She's busy.**"  
("He/She" have same pronunciation in Chinese )  
  
Mum:"Maybe you should find time to meet."  
  
-"**I'm going to take a nap.**"  
  
Mum:"Good, as you haven't slept for days."

## October 5th  
  
I dreamed. You were there.  
It's the Night City.  
  
I dreamed that you ran away.  
I was caught, cut off at the waist and torn in half from my upper and lower jaws.  
  
You survived, it worth.  
  
Then I was woken up by my laugh...

Bro:"How long did you play the Mortal Kombat last night?"  
  
-"**8? 9? 11? I don't remember.**"  
  
Mum:"Breakfast is on the table. You have only eaten 2 meals since you came home."  
  
-"**Okay...then I don't need to eat anything after finish this...**"  
  
## October 6th (Midnight)  
  
Gosh, I can see you online!  
  
You unblocked me???  
  
Your ID changed.  
You don't follow me, either do I.  
But you are in my contact...  
  
What happened?  
Something went wrong with META's server?  
  
I did not dare to follow you.  
I'm afraid if it's really a bug.  
My action will refresh my state then I can't see you again...  
  
Wow you are online...  
Off...On again...Off...  
  
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   
  
It's 4 AM now.  
You haven't went online any more.  
  
You sleep?  
Good night!  
  
I'm also going to sleep, my train is about to leave in 2 hours......  
  
It's nice that you are back !  
  
## October 6th (Afternoon)
  
I followed you during my trip on the train in the morning.  
  
Seems like it's not a bug.  
  
Then why?  
  
You must also see me online last morning.  
Then why saying nothing?  
  
You waiting for my message?  
  
**What's your point of view?**
