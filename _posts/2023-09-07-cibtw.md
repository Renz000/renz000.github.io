## September 7th
This is the day I went go out for the college. We planned to arrive there one day early than the original plan, and take a break in the hotel.  
  
I love my home, 'cause my server is there. Even I can get access to it when outside, I prefer the closer connection, the connection that I can see, or touch.  
  
"Things now r turning bad ðŸ˜­"  
  
It was midnight, I was there, sitting alone, trying all ways through the Internet, but nothing helped.  
  
Let me find someone to chat, to distract my anxiety.  
  
**Rin**, she must be there. For nothing but just it's evening in her place.  
  
I didn't except replies that chould be satisfying, which made me surprised after what I got.

Huh? ? !  
What the hell is she saying?  
HAHA, what a ridiculous reply!

***But I like it......***  

I didn't solve the problem this night.  
I also stayed up late.  
  
However  
  
**I slept very comfortable.**  
**I could notice something in my heart......**  
**It's bumping, growing, warming.......**  
  
***Could It be the Weather?***
